    abstract = {Summary The spatial distribution of solids and moisture depends on a number of factors, such as solute type, solution concentration, osmosis time, osmosis temperature and solution agitation. The spatial distribution was characterized by two terms: (i) the depth of penetration of the osmosis effect (e.g. depth to which solids concentration is higher than that found in the original tissue), and (ii) the moisture content of the surface relative to the initial moisture content. It was shown that to obtain usable distribution information, shrinkage of the sample which is occurring in the osmosis process must be considered in the calculations. Osmosis distribution curves were very different for osmosis in sucrose or in salt solutions. A model based on the development of a compacted surface tissue layer and on the presence of a liquid surface film for non-agitated systems is used to explain observed behaviour for osmosis in concentrated sucrose solutions. Osmosis in salt solutions is shown to follow a much different model, in which a significant salt transport occurs. Sucrose/salt mixtures show behaviour characteristics typical for osmosis in each of the pure solutes. On the basis of these models, the improved osmosis behaviour and improved product quality reported in the literature for products osmosed in mixed sucrose-salt solutions having sucrose concentrations above 40\% is discussed.},
