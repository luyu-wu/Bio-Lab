    abstract = {Summary The spatial distribution of solids and moisture depends on a number of factors, such as solute type, solution concentration, osmosis time, osmosis temperature and solution agitation. The spatial distribution was characterized by two terms: (i) the depth of penetration of the osmosis effect (e.g. depth to which solids concentration is higher than that found in the original tissue), and (ii) the moisture content of the surface relative to the initial moisture content. It was shown that to obtain usable distribution information, shrinkage of the sample which is occurring in the osmosis process must be considered in the calculations. Osmosis distribution curves were very different for osmosis in sucrose or in salt solutions. A model based on the development of a compacted surface tissue layer and on the presence of a liquid surface film for non-agitated systems is used to explain observed behaviour for osmosis in concentrated sucrose solutions. Osmosis in salt solutions is shown to follow a much different model, in which a significant salt transport occurs. Sucrose/salt mixtures show behaviour characteristics typical for osmosis in each of the pure solutes. On the basis of these models, the improved osmosis behaviour and improved product quality reported in the literature for products osmosed in mixed sucrose-salt solutions having sucrose concentrations above 40\% is discussed.},

    abstract = {The effect of the concentration of sucrose solutions on the cellular structure of potato tissue in equilibrium at 27 °C was studied. Two different methods of investigation were used to determine the volume of the different phases composing the cellular tissue of the potato when in equilibrium with the solutions, one based on data of the concentration itself and the overall volume of 2 mm slices after 48 h at equilibrium, and the other on microscopic images of cells in thin slices of fresh tissue stained with neutral red after an hour in equilibrium to show protoplasts, vacuoles and plasmolysis spaces. The results of these methods were compared with those obtained by a predictive thermodynamic approach considering the semipermeability of cell membranes. Phase volume data obtained from microscopic analysis were more similar to what was predicted by the theoretical model than those obtained by means of composition measurement, where the long equilibrium time apparently led to the loss of semipermeability of the cell membranes, since total volumes calculated without consideration of the cell membranes were similar to those measured. This suggests that the length of time of osmotic dehydration brings about a change in cell structure and the consequent involvement of a different mechanism in mass transfer.},
